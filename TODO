* core:
    * separate hierarchies: childs vs. frames
    * rethink message routing to su-widgets
    * more efficient widget list -> use arrays instead of linked-list ?
	--> use backref ?

* misc widgets:
    * pixmap button

* widget-list:
    * rethink the name parameter
	--> currently it just sets the widget's name
	--> originally, the list entries were meant to hold the name on their own
	    (so, we can have different names for childs vs subframes)

* xcb target:
    * repaint loop

* drm target:
    * repaint loop
